# AspDotNetCoreRTM.Swagger.AutoRest
A sample project using ASP.NET Core RTM to implement a Swagger API that then uses AutoRest to create the Client and the  .NET Core Web App to consume that client.

You will need to launch this in 2 instances of Visual Studio, one to run the API project and the other to run the Web project.

To regen the client, just run the Client app.
